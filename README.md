**Coolblue Analytics Engineer Assignment â€” Delta Coffee**

Hi future team! Welcome to this repository for my Analytics Engineer assignment as part of the Coolblue hiring process.
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a modern analytics stack â€” from raw data ingestion to a well-modeled warehouse ready for business analysis.

The goal of this exercise is to show how sales and campaign data can be:
- Modeled for flexible, multi-dimensional analysis
- Transformed and prepared using ELT best practices (e.g., dbt)
- Combined to deliver insights into campaign performance, actuals vs. forecasts, and top-performing products and stores
